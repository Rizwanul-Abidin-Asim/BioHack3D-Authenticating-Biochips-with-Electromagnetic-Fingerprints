# BioHack3D-Authenticating-Biochips-with-Electromagnetic-Fingerprints üîê‚ö°
This project secured me and my team second place in the BioHack3D Hackathon among 17 other teams competing across MENA region!
In an era where biomedical security is paramount, BioHack3D pioneers an avant-garde approach to biochip authentication through the analysis of electromagnetic spun fingerprints. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning architectures like **MobileNetV2, Xception, and InceptionV3,** this model discerns authentic and inauthentic biochips with unparalleled precision.

The pipeline integrates **advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation** (flip, zoom, rotation), and feature extraction to enhance model generalization. Utilizing **TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Augmentor**, it refines biochip images, mitigating noise and enhancing classification accuracy. A meticulous fine-tuning phase ensures optimal performance, with evaluations using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves.

This cutting-edge solution fortifies biomedical authentication, mitigating security risks in next-gen bioelectronics. By transforming electromagnetic patterns into AI-powered authentication markers, BioHack3D heralds a revolution in biochip security and integrity. üöÄüî¨
